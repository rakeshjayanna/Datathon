Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnosis using KNN and Cross Validation
Project Overview-
This project focuses on diagnosing breast cancer using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, integrated with cross-validation techniques for robust model evaluation. The dataset used is the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which consists of features related to tumor characteristics, helping to classify tumors as either benign or malignant.

Key Features -
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, yet powerful classification algorithm used to identify whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on its proximity to other data points.
Cross-Validation: The project employs cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well on unseen data, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.
IBM Z Integration: This solution leverages IBM Z's high-performance computing for processing large datasets efficiently while ensuring data security and real-time analysis.
Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is loaded and cleaned.
Missing values, if any, are handled.
Features are standardized to ensure that KNN distances are calculated accurately.

KNN Implementation:
KNN is applied to classify tumor data based on proximity to other data points.
Various values of K (number of neighbors) are tested to identify the optimal model.

Cross-Validation:
A k-fold cross-validation approach is used to evaluate the model's performance.
This technique helps avoid overfitting and ensures the model's robustness on new data.

Model Evaluation:
The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the model are calculated to assess its performance.
Results are visualized using graphs for better interpretation.

Prerequisites- Python 3.x
               Libraries:pandas
                        numpy
                        scikit-learn
                        matplotli

Installation-
1. Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breast-cancer-knn-crossvalidation.git
cd breast-cancer-knn-crossvalidation
2. Install required libraries:pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the project:python main.py

Usage-
Adjust K: You can modify the value of K (number of neighbors) in the knn model to experiment with different outcomes.
Cross-Validation Folds: Change the number of folds in the cross-validation to see how the model performs with different validation strategies.
Results-
The model achieves an accuracy of over 95% in classifying tumors as benign or malignant.
Cross-validation ensures the model performs well on new data, providing reliable predictions.
